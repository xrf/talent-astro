observables (for the 4%):
- light/photons
- wavelength
- polarization "pol^n_"
- cosmic rays (non-photons)
- neutrinos
- experiments
- composition (meteorites, lunar)

forest lines = multiple redshifted lines
deuterium appears as a slightly lower wavelength compared to H
("thumbprint of deuterium")
deuterium is fragile = primordial material [very sensitive baryometer]

information encoded in spectra

abundance (molar fraction) Y = n / (rho N_A)
where n is number density, rho is mass density, and N_A is the Avogadro number.

mass fraction, X = A Y where A is molecular weight

cross section is a function of relative velocity (= energy)
reaction rate is a function of temperature (!= energy)

for MB distribution
= integral sigma(E) E exp(-E) dE

S-factor is slowly varying, keV-barns

why does graph go to zero at 0 radius?
